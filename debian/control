Description: thin-wrapper around mock for easier use with py.test (Python 3 module)
 This plugin installs a "mocker" fixture which is a thin-wrapper
 around the patching API provided by the excellent "mock" package, but
 with the benefit of not having to worry about undoing patches at the
 end of a test.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 module.
